# Compilational Authorship Manifesto
### A New Perspective on Authorship in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

---

## 1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) generates texts, code, images, and music, yet none of these outputs emerge from nothing.  
Every AI creation is a **composition** of the work, knowledge, and creativity of many people accumulated over decades.  
Nevertheless, current legal and technological practices often tend to **erase these human authors**, as if they never existed.

This manifesto asserts the opposite: **AI is not an author, but a compiler**.  
Therefore, we must recognize **compilational authorship** — a new form of authorship that reflects the real human contribution to AI-generated works.

## 2. What is Compilational Authorship

**Compilational authorship** is the principle that an AI-generated work is:  
- *derived* from many other works,  
- *algorithmically compiled*,  
- and *emerging from human collaboration through technology*.

The essence of this principle is to distinguish AI as a **tool** from the humans who:  
1. **Created the AI system itself** (architecture, training logic, parameters);  
2. **Produced the data** on which AI was trained (program code, articles, art, linguistic examples).

Thus, an AI output becomes a **product of human creative synthesis**, rather than an “autonomous work.”

## 3. Core Principles

### 1. AI cannot be an author
AI lacks consciousness, intent, or creative will.  
Authorship is an ethical and cultural category tied to human intention and responsibility.  
Therefore, AI can only be a **tool in creation**, similar to a camera or a computer.

### 2. Human contributions must not be erased
All data used to train AI must have clear **provenance documentation**.  
Each generated result must retain **traces of authors** — metadata indicating the sources or licenses from which the model’s knowledge originated.

### 3. AI developers must acknowledge both engineers and sources
AI model documentation should include two layers:  
1. **Developer layer** — who built the model and its architecture;  
2. **Training data layer** — whose works or data were used.

### 4. Transparency is essential for ethics and legal foundations
Without traceability to data sources, it is impossible to properly address licensing, responsibility, or intellectual property issues.  
Compilational authorship requires that the **chain of AI creation and use be transparent**.

### 5. Collective recognition — the new ethics of creation
AI works belong to the **collective cultural domain**.  
Each result should be understood as a reflection of shared human knowledge, creativity, and technological effort.

## 4. Why It Matters

Without compilational authorship:  
- **cultural continuity is lost**, as works lose their origin;  
- **authors’ visibility disappears**, as their work becomes indistinguishable from the models;  
- **ethical debt increases** toward open-source and creative communities.

Compilational authorship restores balance:  
it merges technological progress with respect for human creativity.

---

## 5. Proposal

We call upon:  
- AI developers and organizations to implement **data provenance traceability systems**;  
- Legal experts to integrate the **principle of compilational authorship** into intellectual property law;  
- Society to demand **transparency and recognition** beyond each AI-generated output.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence does not change the essence of creation — it only extends its scope.  
Every AI creation is a **reflection of humanity’s collective creativity**.  
Only by recognizing compilational authorship can we ensure that this reflection is not empty, but a tribute to all who contributed to the evolution of collective creation.

## 7. Authorship Statement

> This manifesto was created in collaboration with the AI system **GPT-5**, under the guidance of a human author who directed the ideas, arguments, and structure.  
> The AI acted as an **editor and compiler of text**, not as an autonomous author.  
> This reflects the very principle of the manifesto itself — creation as a **compilational process** between human and technology.
