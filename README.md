# Compilational Authorship Manifesto

This repository hosts the **Compilational Authorship Manifesto**, proposing a new perspective on authorship in the age of AI.

The manifesto argues that AI is not an author but a **compiler of human creativity**, and that both AI developers and the authors of training data should be credited.

## Authorship Note

This manifesto was created in collaboration with the AI system **GPT-5**, under the guidance of a human author who directed the ideas, arguments, and structure.  
The AI acted as an **editor and compiler of text**, not as an autonomous author.  
This reflects the very principle of the manifesto itself — creation as a **compilational process** between human and machine.
